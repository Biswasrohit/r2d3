## 🧐 Project Overview

This project implements a compact, dual-axis solar tracker that:

- **Senses** sunlight intensity using a small solar panel as both a sensor and energy source.  
- **Adjusts** panel orientation in real time via two servo motors (one for horizontal rotation, one for vertical tilt).  
- **Locks** onto the brightest direction using a dynamic, local‐scan algorithm—no full 180° sweep on each update.  
- **Demonstrates** how mechanical design, electronics integration, and firmware must co-evolve in a hands-on engineering build.

Inspired by the droid **R2D2**, our “R2D3” tracker combines playful form with practical function.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dual-Axis Control**: Independent azimuth & elevation tracking.  
- **Analog Feedback**: Reads voltage from the panel (A0) to detect light intensity.  
- **Dynamic Local Scan**: Reduces scan range for faster, more efficient tracking.  
- **PLA 3D-Printed Enclosure**: Renewable polylactic acid parts customized in SolidWorks.  
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation between electronics housing and moving head.

## 💻 Software & Firmware

- **Arduino Sketch**  
  - `readVoltage()`: Reads and maps panel voltage (A0 → 0–5 V).  
  - `trackAzimuth()` / `trackElevation()`: Local-scan routines to find the brightest “hotspot.”  
  - Safety checks to prevent over-rotation beyond physical limits.

- **Dependencies**  
  - Arduino IDE (v1.8+) or Arduino CLI  
  - No external libraries required (uses core Servo & Arduino APIs)

---

## 🏗️ CAD & 3D Prints

- **SolidWorks Models**  
  - `CAD/LowerBase.SLDPRT` – Electronics housing with wiring pass-through  
  - `CAD/UpperHemisphere.SLDPRT` – Rotating head to support the panel  
  - `CAD/Assembly.SLDASM` – Full dual-axis assembly  

- **3D-Print Files**  
  - `STL/LowerBase.stl`  
  - `STL/UpperHemisphere.stl`  
  - `STL/MountingArm.stl`  

> **Tip:** Print at 0.2 mm layer height with 20% infill for a balance of strength and speed.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run your R2D3 solar tracker:

1. **Clone the repository**  
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/R2D3-Solar-Tracker.git  
    cd R2D3-Solar-Tracker

2. **3D-print the parts**  
    - Slice the files in STL/ with your preferred slicer  
    - Recommended settings: PLA, 0.2 mm layer height, 20 % infill, 60 °C bed, 200 °C nozzle

3. **Assemble the hardware**  
    - Secure the horizontal servo into LowerBase.stl  
    - Thread wiring through the base passthrough hole  
    - Attach the secondary cylindrical base and upper hemisphere (UpperHemisphere.stl) to the horizontal horn  
    - Mount the vertical servo and solar panel in the hemisphere using the popsicle-stick armature

4. **Wire the electronics**  
    - Power servos from Arduino 5 V & GND; signal pins to D9 (horizontal) and D10 (vertical)  
    - Connect panel’s positive lead to A0 and negative lead to GND  
    - Tidy cables through built-in channels

5. **Upload the firmware**  
    - Open firmware/R2D3_Tracker.ino in the Arduino IDE (v1.8+)  
    - Select “Arduino Uno” and the correct serial port  
    - Click “Upload”

6. **Power and test**  
    - Plug Arduino into USB-A (PC or power bank)  
    - Observe initial local scan, then place under a lamp or sunlight—panel should smoothly follow the brightest spot

## 📊 Usage

- **Initial Scan:** On power-up, performs a limited sweep around last known position to find the brightest direction  
- **Continuous Tracking:** Every 5 seconds (configurable in firmware), updates azimuth/elevation within a ±30° “hotspot” zone  
- **Safety Limits:**  
    - Azimuth: –90° to +90°  
    - Elevation: 25° to 155°

Modify these ranges in `trackAzimuth()` and `trackElevation()` to suit your hardware.

---

## 📈 Results & Performance

- **Dual-Axis Operation:** Azimuth (±90°) and elevation (25–155°) confirmed  
- **Response Time:** < 2 s to reorient within a 30° hotspot  
- **Accuracy:** Typically within 10–15° of peak illumination  
- **Robustness:** Maintains lock under partial occlusion and changing light
